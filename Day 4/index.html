        <p class="paragraph">
            A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor Fran√ßois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.
